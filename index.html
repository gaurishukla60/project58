        <p>Importance of Reading Books
            Reading is important because it develops our thoughts, gives us endless knowledge and lessons while keeping our minds active. Books can hold and keep all kinds of information, stories, thoughts and feelings unlike anything else in this world.What should you be reading?
            So, what should you be reading? The short answer is: Whatever you can get your hands on.

            There was a time when remote regions had to rely on librarians traversing the mountains with books stuffed in saddlebags. But thatâ€™s hardly the case today. Just about everyone can access vast libraries contained in cellphones and tablets.</p>
